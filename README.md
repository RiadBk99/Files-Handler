***FILES HANDLER***

A program built using java language with window builder library for javaSwing GUI,
files and data are easily accessed using hashmaps, used multiple databases such as queue/trees to
receive the required results.

The program is made to handle files in the following way:
A Project is opened or selected, files are uploaded from the computer using the software,
each file is viewed in a frame called "Factory" and proccessed to a folder in the current project,
all files proccessed are moved the project database and can be viewed at all times.

***INCOMING MAJOR UPDATE***

Working on making the program work as a client to a main server, all files
will be held in the main server only and accessable only through maintained accounts.
